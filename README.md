## Description

This is my capstone project for the Springboard Software Engineering Bootcamp course.

The vision for ProPulse is to create a social media-like environment for communication. Simple, efficient, and intuitive.

Users can create a project thread, invite fellow users to the project thread as they see fit, and post or reply to fellow participants. If you want to grab a specific person's attention, you can tag them in your post or reply, and they will receive a notification if they've given consent.

## TLDR

My goal with ProPulse is to streamline project communication.

Inspired by my many years as a fire sprinkler installation foreman, I felt that many project communication apps were too bloated, cumbersome, and unnecessarily complex (I'm looking at you, Procore).

Email chains were just as bad. Sometimes communication needs to be compartmentalized on a per team basis. I would often find myself included in MASSIVE email chains with architects, engineers, CEOs, and more. What's worse, many of these messages and conversations were far outside the realm of the "boots on the ground" team's concern. It often felt like a flood of useless information, and if there were to be any relevant content, it would surely be lost in the wave.

The intent with ProPulse is to provide a dedicated channel for teams that need to communicate often, without the need to sift through the clutter. Each project thread can function as a repository of information. I believe this can greatly boost productivity amongst a team, simply due to the fact that important information is less likely to be overlooked or forgotten about, as is the case with email, text, phone calls, and bloated project management apps.
